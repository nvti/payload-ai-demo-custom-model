# Payload AI demo custom models

This is a demo of using custom models with [Payload AI](https://github.com/ashbuilds/payload-ai)

This example creates a custom model that uses [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) to generate text.
The custom model code can be found in `src/custom-models/openrouter.ts`
